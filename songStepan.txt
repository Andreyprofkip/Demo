1
When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be

2
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be

3
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be

4
For though they may be parted there is
Still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer
Let it be
